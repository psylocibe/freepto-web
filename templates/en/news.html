        <p><strong>July 9, 2015</strong> - What the HackingTeam leaks says about Freepto<br />
        You may have learned that the security company Hacking Team — specialized
        in system intrusion and digital surveillance — has allegedely been hacked,
        and a lot of their data is now freely accessible on the Internet.<br />
        It seems they have Linux exploits too, mostly based on a Flash zero-day
        vulnerability. Version 0.1.1 was vulnerable to this exploit, but we
        have no evidence that any later versions are affected.<br />
        <br />
        The current situation about Flash has improved much, because Freepto has
        had a "click-to-play-flash" feature from 1.0.<br />
        While click-to-play is useful, it's not a magic wand: the user could be
        tricked into enabling Flash if the domain "looks familiar", despite
        the actual Flash content may not be secure.<br />
        Therefore we don't deem Freepto 1.0 to be completely safe against this attack.<br />
        <br />
        Since the last development session at HackIT, <a href="https://github.com/AvANa-BBS/freepto-lb/pull/149">we've been working on removing Flash</a>.<br />
        <br />
        For sure we need to investigate the situation better; we will keep you posted.<br />
